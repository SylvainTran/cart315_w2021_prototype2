Prototype 2: Momma Cub!

This is a management and training simulator with a virtual economy.

# 1-week prototyping

Playtesters: Game prototype was frozen around 11:20 PM (last hotfix pushed) on February 24th. The versions before are obsolete.

The interest in this project was to create a hypercasual lighthearted themed game.

# 1-week iteration

The goal of this iteration was to address clarity issues in the training centre and the overall game flow. Making the player game flow and training process clear were the main goals. A secondary goal was to implement challenges in the design of the training centre's mini-game. A stretch goal is to add to the slaughterhouse feature.

# 1-week summary

I've decided to address the issues of clarity raised in playtesters' feedback.

I mainly added tutorials for step-by-step instructions and revised it for clarity.

The player now starts at a logical point in the game: where they have to first buy a cub to see what it is they're playing with mainly.

The player starts with a single cub as suggested in the feedbacks. Then I walk the player step-by-step.

I've attempted to make the mini-game at the training centre clearer and refine its workings.

The next iteration would be to add the slaughterhouse and make the overall game more playable from end to finish.
